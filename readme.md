## Operating Systems Lab Programs

This repository contains all of the programs made by me in OS Lab (CEN-493) B.Tech Computer Engineering 4th Sem (2022) at JMI. 

The programs were made using C and were compilable using gcc 9.4.0 on a posix based system. Most of the data structures that are used have been implemented from scratch.

#### List of programs:
1. [Priority Queue Scheduling using Linked Lists](priority_queue_ll.c)
2. [First Come First Serve Scheduling (FCFS)](fcfs.c)
3. [Shortest Job First Scheduling (SJF)](sjf.c)
4. [Shortest Remaining Time First Scheduling (SRTF)](srtf.c)
5. [Round Robin Scheduling (RR)](round_robin.c)
6. [Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling](priority.c)
7. [Preemptive Priority Scheduling](pre_priority.c)
8. [Non-Premptive Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN)](hrrn.c)
9. [First Fit Memory Allocation](first_fit.c)
10. [Best Fit Memory Allocation](best_fit.c)
11. [Next Fit Memory Allocation](next_fit.c)
12. [Worst Fit Memory Allocation](worst_fit.c)
13. [First In First Out (FIFO) Page Replacement](fifo.c)
14. [Least Recently Used (LRU) Page Replacement](lru.c)
15. [FCFS, SSTF and SCAN Disk Scheduling](fcfs_sstf_scan.c)
 

Many of the programs were made by takind care of edge-cases which are usually ignored by simple OS codes taught in online/offline courses. If you find a bug or an edge case not considered, please feel free to point it out or make a PR.
